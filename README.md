Welcome to the NerdyJoy App repository! 

Down below is a guide for developers this repository: 

1. Add comments to your code to make the function of the code clear (it will be easier to read & understand your code.)  

2. If you make any changes to the code you uploaded, report it with information about the version and reason for the change.
